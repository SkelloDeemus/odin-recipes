        awesome sauce and as many toppings you can stuff under the bun.</p>
    <p>This is how to make the <strong><em> BEST CHEESEBURGER!</em></strong> Perfect burger patties every single time
        and I will even throw in an
        awesome sauce to complete this mouth watering delicacy.</p>

        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef, <em>80/20</em></li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, <em>to taste</em></li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>6 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>Brioche hamburger buns</li>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Burger Sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, ketchup, dill pickle relish and Dijon; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine beef, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper. Using a wooden spoon or clean hands, stir until well combined. Gently form into 6 1-inch-thick patties, about the size of the hamburger buns.</li>
