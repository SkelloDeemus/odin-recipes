    <h2>The secret to making the caribbean dish your craving!</h2>
    <p> Jamaican jerk chicken is fairly simple to prepare. Once you've gathered all your ingredients, everything but the
        chicken gets whizzed in the food processor to make a marinade. It's important to let the chicken marinate
        overnight, so the seasoning has time to thoroughly penetrate the meat</p>
    <p>The key to this specific recipe is including a five-spice powder in the marinade, a Chinese spice blend made of
        cinnamon, fennel seed, cloves, Sichuan peppercorns, and star anise.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium onion, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>3 medium scallions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 Scotch bonnet chiles, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon five-spice powder</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon allspice berries, coarsely ground</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme, crumbled</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 (3 1/2 to 4-pound) chickens, quartered</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a food processor, combine the onion, scallions, chiles, garlic, five-spice powder, allspice, pepper,
            thyme, nutmeg, and salt; process to a coarse paste. With the machine on, add the soy sauce and oil in a
            steady stream. Pour the marinade into a large, shallow dish, add the chicken, and turn to coat. Cover and
            refrigerate overnight. Bring the chicken to room temperature before proceeding.
        </li>
        <li>Light a grill. Grill the chicken over a medium-hot fire, turning occasionally, until well browned and cooked
            through, 35 to 40 minutes. (Cover the grill for a smokier flavor.) Transfer the chicken to a platter and
            serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
