    <h2>Want to make your own tasty peppers? Here's the guide for you!</h2>
    <p>These delicious treats are strong enough to hold shape while also large enough to
        hold a great amount of filling taking on a variety of flavors. Just perfect for the
        adventurous consumer.

    <p>In this recipe we will be filling ours with beefy tomato rice and shredded cheese,
